# Guidance Counseling App - Client

This is the React frontend for the Guidance Counseling application, built with Vite.

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables.

1.  Create a file named `.env.development` in the `client` directory.
2.  Copy the contents from `.env.example` into your new file.
3.  Set the `VITE_API_URL` to point to your local backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

For production, a `.env.production` file will be needed with the URL of your live backend API.


## Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`


The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
