### 🔍 Empty/Non-Functional Files Identified

**Files with minimal/no functionality:**
- `client/src/pages/Shared/render.yaml` - Configuration file, not code
- `server/scripts/addAdmin.js` - Admin creation script (needs testing)
- `server/answered_pdfs/` - Empty directory for processed files
- `server/submitted/` - Empty directory for submissions
- `server/uploads/` - Empty directory for uploads

**Note:** These empty directories are expected for file storage and will be populated during runtime.
