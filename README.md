    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development

    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # Client URL for CORS
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # From the server directory
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend client:**
    ```bash
    # From the client directory
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to Render using the `render.yaml` file in the root directory.

### Steps to Deploy on Render

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  Go to the Render Dashboard and create a new **Blueprint**.
3.  Connect the GitHub repository you just forked. Render will automatically detect and use the `render.yaml` file.
4.  **Add Secret Environment Variables:** Before the first deployment, you must manually add the following environment variables in the Render dashboard for your `guidance-counseling-api` service.
    -   `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    -   `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random, and secret string for signing tokens.
    -   `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name.
    -   `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key.
    -   `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret.

5.  Render will automatically build and deploy both the backend API and the frontend static site. The services will be linked, and the correct URLs will be injected as environment variables.
